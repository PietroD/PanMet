# PanMet
Pan-cancer analysis of metastatic samples

The idea is to mine databases for cancer metastatic samples that have
paired normal ones and perform differential gene expression analysis
among all the cancer to identify genes that drive the metastatization
process across all cancer types.

Would be interesting also if these samples would have copy number and/or
methylation data associated.

Use database information from HCMDB (http://hcmdb.i-sanger.com).
